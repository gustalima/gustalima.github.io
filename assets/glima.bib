abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Advances in synchrotron storage rings and beamline automation have pushed data-collection rates to thousands of data sets per week. With this increase in throughput, massive projects such as in-crystal fragment screening have become accessible to a larger number of research groups. The quality of support offered at large-scale facilities allows medicinal chemistry-focused or biochemistry-focused groups to supplement their research with structural biology. Preparing the experiment, analysing multiple data sets and prospecting for interesting complexes of protein and fragments require, for both newcomers and experienced users, efficient management of the project and extensive computational power for data processing and structure refinement. Here, FragMAX, a new complete platform for fragment screening at the BioMAX beamline of the MAX IV Laboratory, is described. The ways in which users are assisted in X-ray-based fragment screenings and in which the fourth-generation storage ring available at the facility is best exploited are also described.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BioMAX is the first macromolecular crystallography beamline at the MAX IV Laboratory 3 GeV storage ring, which is the first operational multi-bend achromat storage ring. Due to the low-emittance storage ring, BioMAX has a parallel, high-intensity X-ray beam, even when focused down to 20 µm × 5 µm using the bendable focusing mirrors. The beam is tunable in the energy range 5–25 keV using the in-vacuum undulator and the horizontally deflecting double-crystal monochromator. BioMAX is equipped with an MD3 diffractometer, an ISARA high-capacity sample changer and an EIGER 16M hybrid pixel detector. Data collection at BioMAX is controlled using the newly developed MXCuBE3 graphical user interface, and sample tracking is handled by ISPyB. The computing infrastructure includes data storage and processing both at MAX IV and the Lund University supercomputing center LUNARC. With state-of-the-art instrumentation, a high degree of automation, a user-friendly control system interface and remote operation, BioMAX provides an excellent facility for most macromolecular crystallography experiments. Serial crystallography using either a high-viscosity extruder injector or the MD3 as a fixed-target scanner is already implemented. The serial crystallography activities at MAX IV Laboratory will be further developed at the microfocus beamline MicroMAX, when it comes into operation in 2022. MicroMAX will have a 1 µm × 1 µm beam focus and a flux up to 10 15 photons s −1 with main applications in serial crystallography, room-temperature structure determinations and time-resolved experiments.},

Among the clinical manifestations of the disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by species of Leishmania braziliensis, presents wide distribution in Brazil. In this work, we performed the cloning, expression, and purification of the enzyme superoxide dismutase of Leishmania braziliensis (LbSOD-B2) considered a promising target for the search of new compounds against leishmaniasis. In vitro assays based on pyrogallol oxidation showed that LbSOD-B2 is most active around pH 8 and hydrogen peroxide is a LbSOD-B2 inhibitor at low millimolar range (IC50{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}={\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}1 mM).},

abstract = {Background: The Ceratocystis genus harbors a large number of phytopathogenic fungi that cause xylem parenchyma degradation and vascular destruction on a broad range of economically important plants. Ceratocystis cacaofunesta is a necrotrophic fungus responsible for lethal wilt disease in cacao. The aim of this work is to analyze the genome of C. cacaofunesta through a comparative approach with genomes of other Sordariomycetes in order to better understand the molecular basis of pathogenicity in the Ceratocystis genus. Results: We present an analysis of the C. cacaofunesta genome focusing on secreted proteins that might constitute pathogenicity factors. Comparative genome analyses among five Ceratocystidaceae species and 23 other Sordariomycetes fungi showed a strong reduction in gene content of the Ceratocystis genus. However, some gene families displayed a remarkable expansion, in particular, the Phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipases-C (PI-PLC) family. Also, evolutionary rate calculations suggest that the evolution process of this family was guided by positive selection. Interestingly, among the 82 PI-PLCs genes identified in the C. cacaofunesta genome, 70 genes encoding extracellular PI-PLCs are grouped in eight small scaffolds surrounded by transposon fragments and scars that could be involved in the rapid evolution of the PI-PLC family. Experimental secretome using LC–MS/MS validated 24{\%} (86 proteins) of the total predicted secretome (342 proteins), including four PI-PLCs and other important pathogenicity factors. Conclusion: Analysis of the Ceratocystis cacaofunesta genome provides evidence that PI-PLCs may play a role in pathogenicity. Subsequent functional studies will be aimed at evaluating this hypothesis. The observed genetic arsenals, together with the analysis of the PI-PLC family shown in this work, reveal significant differences in the Ceratocystis genome compared to the classical vascular fungi, Verticillium and Fusarium. Altogether, our analyses provide new insights into the evolution and the molecular basis of plant pathogenicity.},

abstract = {Among the biologically active triterpenes, friedelin has the most-rearranged structure produced by the oxidosqualene cyclases and is the only one containing a cetonic group. In this study, we cloned and functionally characterized friedelin synthase and one cycloartenol synthase from Maytenus ilicifolia (Celastraceae). The complete coding sequences of these 2 genes were cloned from leaf mRNA, and their functions were characterized by heterologous expression in yeast. The cycloartenol synthase sequence is very similar to other known OSCs of this type (approximately 80{\%} identity), although the M. ilicifolia friedelin synthase amino acid sequence is more related to $\beta$-amyrin synthases (65–74{\%} identity), which is similar to the friedelin synthase cloned from Kalanchoe daigremontiana. Multiple sequence alignments demonstrated the presence of a leucine residue two positions upstream of the friedelin synthase Asp-Cys-Thr-Ala-Glu (DCTAE) active site motif, while the vast majority of OSCs identified so far have a valine or isoleucine residue at the same position. The substitution of the leucine residue with valine, threonine or isoleucine in M. ilicifolia friedelin synthase interfered with substrate recognition and lead to the production of different pentacyclic triterpenes. Hence, our data indicate a key role for the leucine residue in the structure and function of this oxidosqualene cyclase. Terpenes are a special group of secondary metabolites. Their biosynthetic pathways begin with the condensation of isoprenyl units, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which con-stitute the building blocks of terpenes with chemical skeletons ranging from 10 to 40 carbons. These compounds are present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic primary metabolism, although they are also present in eukaryotic secondary metabolism 1},

abstract = {Chagas disease, Sleeping Sickness, Nagana and Leishmaniasis are serious infections caused by protozoa of the order Kinetoplastidae. They were described over a century ago by seminal work of different physician-researchers and, despite the initial discoveries, few drugs have been made available for the treatment of these infections. The drugs available present serious efficacy and toxicity problems. Moreover, the emergence of resistant strains has rendered the development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies a priority. Auranofin is currently in use to treat rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Previous reports showed that this compound presents activity against Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania cells. In Trypanosoma cruzi cells, auranofin resulted in a more potent compound than benznidazole in vitro when tested in different DTUs. In vivo experiments, although not decreasing T. cruzi parasitemia, decreases host mortality. Therefore, we propose auranofin as a potential alternative for a new chemotherapy in Chagas disease with the added advantage of already being approved for use in humans.},
